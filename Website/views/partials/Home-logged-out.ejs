                        MyTherapy is a tool for therapists and patients that can 
                        help improve the therapy experience. MyTherapy uses digital 
                        CBT worksheets to gather raw emotional, that would otherwise be
                        lost if using paper worksheets as patients do not always have access to them.
                    </p>

                    <h5>MyTherapy is based on the concept of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</h5>
                    <p>
                        Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) links thought, behavior and emotion to
                        find the root of the patients problems and help them enact real change in 
                        their lives to solve those problems.

                    <p>
                        MyTherapy allows therapists to create a MyTherapy account for their patients to use. 
                        Using this account the patient can fill in a digital CBT worksheet on their phone, PC 
                        or any web capable device. Completed worksheets are stored in a real-time database, allowing 
                        therapists and patient to view them in real-time.
                        Over time, a kind of virtual diary is created consisting of completed worksheets. This can 
                        be used to help establish the link between patients thoughts, emotions and behavior and help 
                        patients enact change to solve their problems
